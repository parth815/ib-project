			<h1>THE AUTHORS</h1>
				<h3>Louise Erdrich - <i> Love Medicine </i></h3>
				<p>Louise Erdrich is a prolific writer who is known for her works on Native American culture. She is widely accalimed for these works, which were a part of a significant increase in works by and on Native American people and communities.</p>
				<p>Her acclaimed 1984 novel <i> Love Medicine </i> is a collection of short stories that follows three generations of a large family living in an unnamed reservation. She explores the the consequences of their actions on each other, and how no matter where they are, they always return to their family.</p>
				<p>Silence plays a large role in many of these stories, often as a side product of family members trying to hide information from each other. Some of them are hiding stories about an aunt, another is trying to keep their brother from finding about PTSD, and a third is attempting to hide grief over the death of his wife. In all these cases, the silence - or lack of it - creates rifts and emotional isolation from the very people trying to help them.</p>

				<h3>Haruki Murakami - <i> The Elephant Vanishes </i></h3>
				<p>Haruki Murakami is a Japanese writer whose literary works have achieved massive international success. Many of his works are characterized by elements of the fantastical or otherworldly appearing as major plot points.</p>
				<p>His 1993 collection of short stories <i> The Elephant Vanishes </i> offers many examples of this. The stories and their characters are completely unrelated, but share emotions such as loneliness, self-destruction, and unwillingness to love.</p>
				<p>In these works, silence works primarily as a force that makes characters think about their actions and their goals. Silence forces one man to confront his fear of isolation, one woman to realize that she is not as free as she thought she was, and one couple to never meet each other in fear that they may push each other away. Just as silence can be be a side-product of isolation, so too can it be the cause of it.</p>

				<h3>Karen Russell - <i> Vampires in the Lemon Grove </i></h3>
				<p>Karen Russell is a fiction writer whose haunting yet comic tales blend fantastical elements with contemporary realism and classic themes of transformation and redemption. Setting much of her work in the Everglades of her native Florida, she depicts in lyrical, energetic prose an enchanting and forbidding landscape and delves into subcultures rarely encountered in contemporary American literature.</p>
				<p>Her 2013 collection of short stories <i> Vampires in the Lemon Grove </i> explores the vast imagination and creativity of Russell’s work.</p>
				<p>From a unique silk factory in 19th century Japan, to presidents reincarnated as horses, Russell utilizes silence as a major theme which appears throughout her works of fiction. This silence isolates characters either from their world or from others, forcing characters to reflect on past crimes. This fuels the common theme of redemption in Russell's stories.</p>
