				<h1><i><marquee>LOVE MEDICINE</marquee></i></h1>
					<h3><font color="red">"World's Greatest Fisherman"</font></h3>
				<p>“Grandpa shook his head, remembering dates with no events to go with them, names without faces, things that happened out of place and time. Or at least it seemed that way to me. Grandma and the others were always hushing up the wild things he said or talking loudly over them.”</p>
				<p>“The two aunts gave her quick, unbelieving looks. Then they were both uneasily silent, neither of them willing to take up the slack and tell the story I knew was about June.”</p>
				<p>“My voice was serious, all of a sudden, and it scared him. He moved away from me, suspicious. I was going to tell him what I’d heard from hanging at the edge of the aunts’ conversations.”</p>
				<h4>The silence of June and the isolation she brought upon herself ironically brings the rest of the family together at her death.</h4>

					<h3><font color="red">"The Island"</font></h3>
				<p>“The look of rage Rushes Bear shot at him needed no words.”</p>
				<p>“One summer long ago, when I was a little girl, he came to Nanapush and the two sat beneath the arbor, talking only in the old language, arguing the medicine ways, throwing painted bones and muttering over what they had lost or gained.”</p>
				<p>“His people spoke past him. Nobody ever let out his real name. Nobody saw him. He lived invisible, and survived.”</p>
				<h4>Moses is literally silent for a large portion of his life even when Lulu is with him. This isolates him from everyone, even Lulu. In fact, she has to isolate herself to step into his isolation, his “island.”</h4>

					<h3><font color="red">"The Red Convertible"</font></h3>
				<p>“He sat in front of it, watching it, and that was the only time he was completely still. But it was the kind of stillness that you see in a rabbit when it freezes and before it will bolt. He was not easy.””</p>
				<p>“No one said anything, even though every time he took a bite of his bread his blood fell onto it until he was eating his own blood mixed in with the food”</p>
				<p>“The headlights reach in as they go down, searching, still lit even after the water swirls over the back end. I wait. The wires short out. It is all finally dark. And then there is only the water, the sound of it going and running and going and running and running.”</p>
				<h4>Henry is silent for a long time and is unable to talk about his PTSD. This silence creates a rift between him and Lyman, who had once been inseparable. Silence and isolation is used here to create conflict and progress the plot, along with causing the eventual character development of Henry. In addition, there is a literal silence after the death of Lyman, where the silence represents a ‘calm’ after the storm.</h4>

					<h3><font color="red">"Crown of Thorns"</font></h3>
				<p>“The sounds from the lake and trees bothered him, so he switched on the television. He turned the volume up as loud as possible.” also, An old vacuum cleaner… turned on his electric shaver.”</p>
				<p>“The voice was blurred, stupidly childish.”</p>
				<p>“She followed him… howling in the open fields.”</p>
				<h4>Here is an example of silence and isolation being caused by noise. Gordie can’t stand the memories that he has of June so he attempts to silence those thoughts with every possible noise in the house. Silence is in the form of noise, as Gordie is trying to silence the sounds of June inside his house.</h4>



				<h1><i><marquee>The Elephant Vanishes</marquee></i></h1>
					<h3><font color="blue">"The Silence"</font></h3>
				<p>“The guy was a singularly quiet fellow; he hardly ever spoke. Yet you couldn’t ask for anyone more clear-cut in his work habits. Faultlessly sincere. Never pushed people too far, never talked about others behind their back, never complained. No matter how overworked he was, he never raised his voice or even arched his brows.”</p>
				<p>“No one in the entire school would speak to me. As if by consensus— it had to be— I got the silent treatment. Even urgent requests from me got a deaf ear. I was avoided like the plague. My existence was wiped from their field of vision.”</p>
				<p>"They’re the real monsters. They’re the ones I have nightmares about. In those dreams, there’s only the silence. And these faceless people. Their silence seeps into everything like ice water. And then it all goes murky. And I’m dissolving and I’m screaming, but no one hears."</p>
				<h4>Silence creates isolation for Ozawa. The silence of others isolated him and causes him to begin to fear that silence. Eventually Ozawa overcomes this and kind of embraces this silence, becoming silent himself but in a good way.</h4>

					<h3><font color="blue">"The Little Green Monster"</font></h3>
				<p>“I breathed as quietly as I could, pretending not to be there.”</p>
				<p>“You are an ugly little monster, you know, I shouted in my mind’s loudest voice— so loud it made my heart reverberate.”</p>
				<p>“Writhing on the floor, the monster tried to move its mouth and speak to me, struggling to open its lips as if it wanted to leave me some final message, to covet some ancient wisdom, some crucial bit of knowledge that it had forgotten to impart to me. Before that could happen, the mouth… and the room filled with the darkness of night.”</p>
				<h4>There is silence literally because the narrator never says a single word as the monster reads her thoughts. On the other hand, there is silence due to the death of the green monster. The narrator uses her mind's loudest voice to create the ultimate silence - that caused by death.</h4>

					<h3><font color="blue">"Sleep"</font></h3>
				<p>“I couldn’t take that. I just wanted to stay by myself and quietly read my book. I wanted to have my hour of swimming every day. I wanted my freedom.”</p>
				<p>“I’ll never get the key. I fall back against the seat, cover my face with my hands. I’m Crying. All I can do is cry. The tears keep pouring out. Locked inside this little box, I can’t go anywhere.”</p>
				<p>“This incomplete drowsiness would continue on and off all day. My head was always foggy. I couldn’t get an accurate fix on the things around me— their distance or mass or texture. The drowsiness would overtake me at regular, wavelike intervals: on the subway, in the classroom, at the dinner table. My mind would slip away from my body. The world would sway soundlessly.”</p>
				<h4>In this story we have the idea of silence leading to isolation, but this isolation not being scary but rather imbuing a sense of freedom. The main character also chooses to stay silent throughout the whole story rather than try to reconnect with people.</h4>

					<h3><font color="blue">"On Seeing the 100% Perfect Girl One Beautiful April Morning"</font></h3>
				<p>“Yes, that’s it, that is what I should have said to her.”</p>
				<p>“And so, when there came a momentary lull in their conversation, the boy said to the girl, ‘Let’s test ourselves-just once. If we really are each other’s 100% perfect lovers, then sometime, somewhere, we will meet again without fail. And when that happens, and we know that we are the 100% perfect ones, we’ll marry then and there. What do you think?'”</p>
				<p>“She wears a white sweater, and in her right hand she holds a crisp, white envelope lacking only a stamp… The envelope could contain every secret she’s ever had.”</p>
				<h4>The man decides not to convey his love to the girl, and instead thinks up later what he should have said. Sometimes he pauses in conversation, sometimes he keeps his thoughts to himself, and sometimes he simply chooses not to talk. Silence acts as a disruptive force which creates a conflict for the main character and his inability to talk with the girl.</h4>



				<h1><i><marquee>Vampires in the Lemon Grove</marquee></i></h1>
					<h3><font color="green">"The Graveless Doll of Eric Mutis"</font></h3>
				<p>“One day, several weeks before the official end of our school term, he vanished, and I honestly had not spoken his name since. Nobody had.”</p>
				<p>“We desperately needed this quiet that only our victims could produce for us, the silence that came after an attack; it was as essential to our friendship as breathing air.”</p>
				<p>"We didn’t talk about Eric Mutis, but the effort of not talking about him made our actual words feel like fizz, just a lot of speedy emptiness."</p>
				<h4>Much like the real Eric Mutis, the doll cannot stand up for itself as it slowly rots away in the pit. Silence plays a large role in this story as we explore the disappearance of the real Eric Mutis and the slow disappearance of the doll of Eric Mutis.</h4>

					<h3><font color="green">"Proving Up"</font></h3>
				<p>“Ma’s begun to talk to the shriveling sheaves in a crazy way, as if they were her thousand thirsty children. My brother pretends not to hear her.”</p>
				<p>“A silence falls over the Zegner family homestead, which Pa splits with his thundering hymn”</p>
				<p>“The wind attacks our naked skin like knives; I can nearly hear Ma’s voice in it, calling me home. But I’m too brave to turn the horse around, and anyhow I wouldn’t know which way to go. White octaves of snow shriek from the tallgrass to the great descending blank of the heavens.”</p>
				<h4>Throughout the story Miles is haunted by images of his deceased sisters and of Norse (his horse). These episodes and thoughts however do not contain sound. Miles does not directly interact with the ghosts that haunt him and instead tends to just see them. Also there is a noticeable lack of sound imagery throughout the story. Silence seems to isolate each family from one another but also the silence of Miles’ ghosts isolates him from everybody else.</h4>

					<h3><font color="green">"Reeling for the Empire"</font></h3>
				<p>“I would have bet my entire five-yen advance that mine would be light grey, like my cats fur. But then I woke and pushed the swollen webbing of my thumb and a sprig of green came out.”</p>
				<p>“They drink down the soup in silence. 'Are we dreaming?' I hear one whisper.”</p>
				<p>“The woman never speaks to us, no matter what questions we shout at her. She simply waits, patiently, for our skeins, and so long as they are acceptable in quality and weight, she slides in our leaves.”</p>
				<h4>The girls are silenced both literally and figuratively. Literally because they are isolated from society and cannot influence any of the events that will happen in their life (at least to begin the story). Figuratively this is shown because the girls can never control the colors of their silks. No one has ever guessed correctly what color they would produce and this silence is later mitigated as the girls are able to change their colors. </h4>

					<h3><font color="green">"The Barn at the End of Our Term"</font></h3>
				<p>“The gonging wasn’t a clock at all, he realized with a warm, spreading horror, but the thudding of his giant equine heart.”</p>
				<p>“Nobody answers him. Every man is scheming in the privacy of his own horse-body.”</p>
				<p>“His son and his youngest daughter were two smudges above the bedside. The boy quietly endeavored to blink good-bye. Then Rutherford’s throat began to close, shutting him off from all words, and he felt himself filling with silence. The silence was a field of cotton growing white and forever inside him. Rutherford wasn’t afraid to die.”</p>
				<h4>They cannot communicate the fact that they are in fact US presidents. Rutherford becomes obsessed with a sheep who he thinks is his wife, but the silence prevents any confirmation until the sheep is shared. This demonstrates that the actions in this story speak louder than words, and silence still lead to freedom for Rutherford after jumping the fence.</h4>
